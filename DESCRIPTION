Description: An adaptive normalization algorithm that selects housekeeping genes
    based on the sample level variability in the data. This is suitable for any data
    obtained from RT-qPCR assays.  A manuscript describing the method is submitted 
    to Genome Biology under ``MiRA-norm: An Adaptive Method for the Normalization of MicroRNA Array Data``, Yuda Zhu et al.
